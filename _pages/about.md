You can call me Sin-Ying or Alina. I am a clinical psychologist and a behavioral data scientist with expertise in behavioral pattern identification/prediction, survey design, A/B testing, and data visualization. 

I worked as a data science consultant in the psychology department at Stony Brook University, providing stats consultation, experimental design modification, coding support, and machine learning expertise to 5 different labs and the department-affiliated clinic. 

I have also worked with cross-state clinical network to inform health policy decisions by helping clinics to utilize their naturalistic, longitudinal, complex human behavioral data, leveraging top-notch quantitative methods.

I am currently a psychology resident on the MIDAS project at Rhode Island Hospital, integrating my specialties in clinical psychology and data science to improve assessment accuracy, clinical outcomes, and equity policies.

## Why Clinical Psychology
People often mistake that clinical psychologists are only familiar with extreme human behaviors. However, we are actually experts in the entire spectrum of human behaviors (don't forget that 20% of the US population has a severe mental illness diagnosis) and ultimate human well-being. We also study human behaviors based on integrate theories considering the bio-pscyho-social factors. We are also experts in qualitative analysis for cognition-emotion-behavior-reinforcement catalysts. Further, we know how to effectively intervene human behaviors and design experiments to carefully study the effectiveness of different approaches based on individual factors.
