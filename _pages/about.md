My name is Sin-Ying. I also go by Alina. I respond to both. <br>
I am a <u>researcher</u>, a <u>data scientist</u>, and also a <u>therapist</u> in mental/behavioral health. <br> 
<br>
I firmly believe that one day we will achieve data-informed, evidence-based, personalized clinical practice. We will be paying the values of healthcare services we receive, not paying for the time we waste. <br>

My specialty lies in identifying idiosyncratic factors that predict differential treatment responses. My research also addresses diagnostic issues and facilitates the development of clinically meaningful outcome matrices to improve prediction accuracy. <br>

I integrate a variety of quantitative methods to approach answers to complex clinical questions. <br>
"Never let a method constrains your imagination" is my motto.<br>
<br>
I am familiar with common statistical methods (e.g., <b>t-test, ANOVA, chi-square, regression</b>) as well as advanced modeling (e.g., <b>multivariate modeling, multilevel modeling, agent-based modeling</b>). <br>
I also published papers in top journals applying novel methods such as <b>network analysis</b> and <b>machine learning</b> to obtain actionable insights from large-scale clinical data (https://scholar.google.com.tw/citations?user=EMc3V7MAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao).<br>
<br>
On top of all the fancy techniques, my true love is <b>data visualization</b>. <br>
Visualization not only helps you deliver a story but also helps you understand your data. <br>
<br>
Although research data is usually shinier and cleaner, I enjoy the process of digging out gems from messy, naturalistic, longitudinal clinical data. <br>
I love talking to people from different disciplines so long as we all want a more reliable and transparent healthcare system. <br>
